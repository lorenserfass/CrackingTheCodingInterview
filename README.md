# Cracking the Coding Interview

These are worked problems from the book.

I type these in a text editor (not IDE), compile on the command line, and test.

These solutions are written before looking at the book's solutions.

If a commit message contains "rough draft," some of the new code was just sketched
out, in simulation of a coding interview, and might have problems.
