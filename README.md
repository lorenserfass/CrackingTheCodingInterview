# Cracking the Coding Interview

These are worked problems from the book.

I type these in a text editor to simulate a coding interview, and compile on the command line.
Later, I polish in an IDE.

These solutions are written before looking at the book's solutions.
I haven't looked at any solutions from the book, or from anywhere else.

If a commit message contains "rough draft," some of the new code was just sketched
out, in simulation of a coding interview, and might have problems.
