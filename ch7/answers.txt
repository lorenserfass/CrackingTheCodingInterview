Exercise 7.1

If your probability of winning a basketball shot is p,
for which values of p would you choose either of these two games:
1) Win a shot.
2) Win at least two out of three shots.

Answer:
If p < .5, pick game 1. If p > .5, pick game 2. (If p = .5, it doesn't matter).

Explanation:
If X is win and O is miss, then there are eight outcomes for game 2.
Outcomes 1-4 are losing, outcomes 5-8 are winning.

1. Prob(OOO) = (1 - p)^3
2. Prob(XOO) = p * (1 - p)^2
3. Prob(OXO) = p * (1 - p)^2
4. Prob(OOX) = p * (1 - p)^2
5. Prob(OXX) = p^2 * (1 - p)
6. Prob(XOX) = p^2 * (1 - p)
7. Prob(XXO) = p^2 * (1 - p)
8. Prob(XXX) = p^3

If you plot p on the x axis and Prob(outcomes 5-8) on the y axis,
the curve is S-shaped.
When p < .5, Prob(outcomes 1-4) is less than p.
When p > .5, Prob(outcomes 5-8) is more than p.


Exercise 7.2

There is an ant on each vertex of an n-vertex polygon.
They all start walking at the same speed at the same time along the sides of the polygon.
What is the probability of a collision? (Each ant can choose to go either direction).

Answer:
1 - 2 / (2^n)

Explanation:
There are 2^n ways the ants could start walking.
In only two of them the ants are all walking the same direction
and won't collide.



Exercise 7.3
Given two lines in a Cartesian plane, write a function to tell
whether they intersect.

Answer:
For generality the lines are expressed as
A1x + B1y = C1
A2x + B2y = C2

Intuitively, if they have the same slope and aren't the same line, they won't intersect.
Otherwise they intersect.

To test same slope, evaluate: (A1*B2 == A2*B1)
If they have the same slope, evaluate this to tell if they are the same line:
(B1*C2 == B2*C1) && (A1*C2 == A2*C1).

Exercise 7.5
Give two squares in the 2d plane, find a line that cuts both squares in half.


Answer:
Average the x and y coordinates of each square to find the two square centers.
The line will go through the two square centers.

7.7
See ThreeFiveSeven.java.
Procedure:
Start with 3, 5, 7.
Then, keep the numbers so far in a set.
To get the next number, compute three things and find the smallest of the three.
A) The next number, if it is formed by multiplying an existing member by 3.
B) The next number, if it is formed by multiplying an existing member by 5.
C) The next number, if it is formed by multiplying an existing member by 7.

For example, to compute (A):
Divide the highest number so far (7) by 3. It is 2.333. Find the next largest number
within the set (which is 3) and multiply it by 3, to make 9.

To easily find the next largest number in the set, you can store the numbers in a binary tree.
Computing the nth number should be proportional to log(n).
